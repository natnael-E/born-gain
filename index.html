        <p1> The most important features of IoT include artificial intelligence, connectivity, sensors, active
            engagement, and small device use. A brief review of these features is given below −
            • AI − IoT essentially makes virtually anything “smart”, meaning it enhances every aspect
            of life with the power of data collection, artificial intelligence algorithms, and networks.
            This can mean something as simple as enhancing your refrigerator and cabinets to detect
            when milk and your favorite cereal run low, and to then place an order with your preferred
            grocer.<br><br>
            • Connectivity − New enabling technologies for networking and specifically IoT
            networking, mean networks are no longer exclusively tied to major providers. Networks
            can exist on a much smaller and cheaper scale while still being practical. IoT creates these
            small networks between its system devices.<br><br>
            • Sensors − IoT loses its distinction without sensors. They act as defining instruments that
            transform IoT from a standard passive network of devices into an active system capable
            of real-world integration.<br><br>
            
            • Active Engagement − Much of today's interaction with connected technology happens
            through passive engagement. IoT introduces a new paradigm for active content, product,
            or service engagement.<br><br>
    
            • Small Devices − Devices, as predicted, have become smaller, cheaper, and more powerful over
            time. IoT exploits purpose-built small devices to deliver its precision, scalability, and versatility.

            <h2>What is IoT?</h2>

    <h3>The description of the Internet of Things is related to different definitions used by several groups
    for promoting the particular concept in the whole world.</h3>
    <br>
<p1>➢ According to the Internet Architecture Board’s (IAB) definition, IoT is the networking of
smart objects, meaning a huge number of devices intelligently communicating in the
presence of internet protocol that cannot be directly operated by human beings but exist as
components in buildings, vehicles or the environment.<br><br>
➢ According to the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) organization’s definition, IoT is
the networking of smart objects in which smart objects have some constraints such as
limited bandwidth, power, and processing accessibility for achieving interoperability
among smart objects.<br><br>
➢ According to the IEEE Communications category magazine’s definition, IoT is a
framework of all things that have a representation in the presence of the internet in such a
way that new applications and services enable the interaction in the physical and virtual
world in the form of Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication in the cloud.<br><br>
➢ According to the Oxford dictionary’s definition, IoT is the interaction of everyday object’s
computing devices through the Internet that enables the sending and receiving of useful
data.<br><br>
➢ The term Internet of Things (IoT) according to the 2020 conceptual framework is expressed
through a simple formula such as:<br><br><br><br>
                    IoT= Services+ Data+ Networks + Sensors
                    <br><br>
Generally, The Internet of Things (IoT) is the network of physical objects or "things" embedded
with electronics, software, sensors, and network connectivity, which enables these objects to
collect and exchange data. IoT is a system of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and
digital machines, objects, animals or people that are provided with unique identifiers and the ability
to transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer
interaction. IoT is a network of devices that can sense, accumulate and transfer data over the
internet without any human intervention.</p1> <br><br>

<h2> Architecture of IoT</h2>
   <p3> The architecture of IoT devices comprises four
    major components: sensing, network, data processing, and application layers</p3><br><br>
    <p><img width="1000" height="1000" length="1100" src="iot-architecture.png"></p>
                    <h5> Figure 1 of Iot Architecture</h5> <br><br>
   
  <p1> <b> 1. Sensing Layer</b> - The main purpose of
    the sensing layer is to identify any
    phenomena in the devices’ peripheral
    and obtain data from the real world.
    This layer consists of several sensors.
    Using multiple sensors for applications
    is one of the primary features of IoT
    devices. Sensors in IoT devices are
    usually integrated through sensor hubs.<br><br>
    A sensor hub is a common connection
    point for multiple sensors that
    accumulate and forward sensor data to
    the processing unit of a device.
    Actuators can also intervene to change
    the physical conditions that generate
    the data. An actuator might, for
    example, shut off a power supply, adjust an airflow valve, or move a robotic gripper in an
    assembly process. Sensors in IoT devices can be classified into three broad categories as
    described below:<br><br>
A. Motion Sensors: Motion sensors measure the change in motion as well as the orientation
of the devices. There are two types of motions one can observe in a device: linear and
angular motions. The linear motion refers to the linear displacement of an IoT device
while the angular motion refers to the rotational displacement of the device.<br><br>

             
   B. Environmental Sensors: Sensors such as Light sensors, Pressure sensors, etc. are
            embedded in IoT devices to sense the change in environmental parameters in the
            device’s peripheral. The primary purpose of using environmental sensors in IoT devices
            is to help the devices to take autonomous decisions according to the changes of a
            device’s peripheral. For instance, environment sensors are used in many applications to
            improve user experience (e.g., home automation systems, smart locks, smart lights, etc.).<br><br>
  C. Position sensors: Position sensors of IoT devices deal with the physical position and
            location of the device. The most common position sensors used in IoT devices are
             magnetic sensors and Global Positioning System (GPS) sensors. Magnetic sensors are
            usually used as digital compass and help to fix the orientation of the device display. On
            the other hand, GPS is used for navigation purposes in IoT devices.<br><br>
<b>2. Network Layer</b> - The network layer acts as a communication channel to transfer data, collected
    in the sensing layer, to other connected devices. In IoT devices, the network layer is
    implemented by using diverse communication technologies (e.g., Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, ZWave, LoRa, cellular network, etc.) to allow data flow between other devices within the same
    network.<br><br>
<b> 3. Data Processing Layer</b> - The data processing layer consists of the main data processing unit
    of IoT devices. The data processing layer takes data collected in the sensing layer and analyses
    the data to make decisions based on the result. In some IoT devices (e.g., smartwatch, smart
    home hub, etc.), the data processing layer also saves the result of the previous analysis to
    improve the user experience. This layer may share the result of data processing with other
    connected devices via the network layer.<br><br>
<b> 4. Application Layer </b>- The application layer implements and presents the results of the data
    processing layer to accomplish disparate applications of IoT devices. The application layer is a
    user-centric layer that executes various tasks for the users. There exist diverse IoT applications,
    which include smart transportation, smart home, personal care, healthcare, etc.</p1><br><br>

<p1>Classic smart home, internet of things, cloud computing and rule-based event processing,
are the building blocks of our proposed advanced smart home integrated compound.
Each component contributes its core attributes and technologies to the proposed composition.
IoT contributes the internet connection and remote management of mobile appliances, incorporated with a variety of sensors.
Sensors may be attached to home related appliances, such as air-conditioning, lights and other environmental devices. 
And so, it embeds computer intelligence into home devices to provide ways to measure home conditions and monitor home appliances’ functionality.
Cloud computing provides scalable computing power, storage space and applications, 
for developing, maintaining, running home services, and accessing home devices anywhere at anytime. <br><br>
